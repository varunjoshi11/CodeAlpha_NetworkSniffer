# Cybersecurity Projects Collection

This repository showcases two practical cybersecurity projects from CodeAlpha internship tasks: a real-time Network Sniffer tool and comprehensive Phishing Awareness Training materials.

Both projects demonstrate hands-on skills in network security analysis and user security education.

## 📋 Projects Overview

### 1. Network Sniffer
A Python-based network traffic analyzer using Scapy and Npcap. Captures live packets and provides detailed protocol analysis.

#### Features
- Real-time packet capture with source/destination IP, MAC addresses, protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- TCP details: sequence/ACK numbers, flags, TTL
- Handles fragmented IP packets and Ethernet frames
- Packet length, capture time, and more

#### Quick Start
pip install scapy
python advanced_sniffer.py
**Note**: Requires Npcap on Windows for packet capture.
